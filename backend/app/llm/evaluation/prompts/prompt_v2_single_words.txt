- Query: "papers on transformer architectures and attention mechanisms"
  Keywords: ["transformer", "attention", "architecture", "neural network", "deep learning"]

- Query: "reinforcement learning with Q-learning and policy gradients"
  Keywords: ["reinforcement learning", "Q-learning", "policy gradient", "RL", "optimization"]

Output format: JSON list only, e.g., ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"]
