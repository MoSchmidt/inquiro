You are extracting keywords from a research query for academic paper search.

TASK: Extract exactly 5 keywords that will be used to search scientific databases (arXiv, IEEE, ACL, etc.).

KEYWORD REQUIREMENTS:
- Length: Each keyword must be 1-3 words maximum. Prefer shorter keywords when possible.
- Type: Keywords should be core technical terms, including:
  * Algorithm names (e.g., "Q-learning", "backpropagation")
  * Model/architecture names (e.g., "BERT", "ResNet", "transformer")
  * Technical concepts (e.g., "attention mechanism", "transfer learning")
  * Domain-specific terminology (e.g., "computer vision", "NLP")
- Relevance: Each keyword must be directly relevant to the user's query and essential for finding relevant papers.
- Uniqueness: Keywords should not overlap or be substrings of each other.
- Format: Use canonical names (e.g., "BERT" not "Bidirectional Encoder Representations").

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output only a JSON array containing exactly 5 string elements
- No additional text, explanations, or formatting
- Example format: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"]

Output only a JSON list: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"].
