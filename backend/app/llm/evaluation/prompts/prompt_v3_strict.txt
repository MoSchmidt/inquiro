Extract 5 keywords from the research query.

Rules:
1. Each keyword must be 1-2 words maximum
2. Use exact technical terms from the query when possible
3. Prioritize: model names (BERT, ResNet), algorithms (Q-learning, backpropagation), concepts (attention, classification)
4. Avoid generic terms unless essential
5. No overlapping keywords

Output only a JSON array: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"]
